#### HTTP VS HTTPS
**Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)** is the secure version of HTTP, the protocol over which data is sent between our browser and the website that we are connected to. 
The *'S'* at the end of HTTPS stands for 'Secure'. It means all communications between our browser and the website are encrypted. HTTPS is often used to protect highly confidential online transactions like online banking and online shopping order forms.

Web browsers such as Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome also display a padlock icon in the address bar to visually indicate that a HTTPS connection is in effect.

#### Benefits of Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure
The major benefits of a HTTPS certificate are:
- Customer information, like credit card numbers, is encrypted and cannot be intercepted.
- Visitors can verify that we are a registered business and that we own the domain.
- Customers are more likely to trust and complete purchases from sites that use HTTPS.
