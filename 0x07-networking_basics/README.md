The **[Open Systems Interconnection model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model)** (OSI model) is a conceptual model that characterizes the communication functions of a telecommunication system without regard to their underlying internal structure and technology.

It is organized from the lowest level to the highest level:
- The lowest level: Layer 1 which is for transmission on physical layers with electrical impulse, light or radio signal
- The highest level: Layer 7 which is for application specific communication like SNMP for emails, HTTP for our web browser, etc

This README describes what each script/program is doing:

The file `0-OSI_model` is an answer file.

The file `1-types_of_network` is an answer file.

The file `2-MAC_and_IP_address` is an answer file.

The file `3-UDP_and_TCP` is an answer file.

The file `4-TCP_and_UDP_ports` is a bash script that displays listening ports.

The file `5-is_the_host_on_the_network` is a bash script that pings an IP address passed as an argument.
