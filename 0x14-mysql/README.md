**Databases** are used to manage various types of data, including business data, customer data, financial data, scientific data, and more.

A primary/replica database cluster is a group of two or more databases that work together to provide high availability and fault tolerance.
In this setup, one database server, known as the primary, is responsible for processing read and write requests from clients.
The primary server writes all changes to a transaction log, which is then shipped to one or more replica servers.

The replica servers are read-only and are used to serve read requests from clients.
The replica servers receive the transaction log from the primary server and apply the changes to their own copies of the database.
This ensures that all servers in the cluster have the same data.

If the primary server fails, one of the replica servers is promoted to become the new primary, and the cluster continues to operate.
This failover process is automatic and transparent to clients.

The primary/replica cluster provides several benefits, including increased availability, improved performance, and scalability.
By spreading the workload across multiple servers, the cluster can handle more requests than a single server.
Additionally, if one server fails, the others can continue to provide service, ensuring that the system remains available to clients.
