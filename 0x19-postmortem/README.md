A **postmortem (or post-mortem)** is a process intended to help you learn from past incidents.
It typically involves an analysis or discussion soon after an event has taken place.

**Postmortems** typically involve blame-free analysis and discussion soon after an incident or event has taken place.
An artifact is produced that includes a detailed description of exactly what went wrong in order to cause the incident, along with a list of steps to take in order to prevent a similar incident from occurring again in the future.
An analysis of how your incident response process itself worked during the incident should also be included in the discussion.
The value of postmortems comes from helping institutionalize a culture of continuous improvement.
This way, teams are better prepared when another incident inevitably occurs with mission- or business-critical systems.

The specifics around conducting postmortems vary from organization to organization.
Regardless of the process, the primary purpose of postmortems should be learning, whether it’s about the systems being managed, the process being followed, or how the organization executes during a crisis.
Additional goals, including identification and implementation of system or process improvements, may be realized depending on the process followed.

In general, an effective postmortem report tells a story. Incident postmortem reports should include the following:

- A high-level summary of what happened - Which services and customers were affected? How long and severe was the issue? Who was involved in the response? How did we ultimately fix the problem?
- A root cause analysis - What were the origins of failure? Why do we think this happened?
- Steps taken to diagnose, assess, and resolve - What actions were taken? Which were effective? Which were detrimental?
- A timeline of significant activity - Centralize key activities from chat conversations, incident details, and more.
- Learnings and next steps - What went well? What didn’t go well? How do we prevent this issue from happening again?
