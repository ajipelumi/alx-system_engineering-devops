**Web infrastructure** refers to the collection of hardware, software, and networking components that are necessary to host, manage, and deliver web applications and services to end-users.

The primary components of web infrastructure typically include:

- **Servers**: These are the physical or virtual machines that host web applications and services. Servers are responsible for processing requests, storing and retrieving data, and serving content to end-users.

- **Databases**: These are the software systems that manage the storage and retrieval of data for web applications. Databases are used to store user profiles, application data, transaction data, and other types of structured and unstructured data.

- **Networking**: This includes the routers, switches, firewalls, and other networking components that are used to connect web applications and services to the internet and to other internal and external networks.

- **Security**: This includes the software and hardware components that are used to protect web applications and services from unauthorized access, hacking, and other security threats. Security components typically include firewalls, intrusion detection systems, encryption tools, and other security measures.

- **Monitoring and management tools**: These are the software tools that are used to monitor and manage the performance, availability, and security of web applications and services.
Monitoring tools provide real-time visibility into the health and performance of web infrastructure components, while management tools enable administrators to configure, deploy, and manage web applications and services more efficiently.
