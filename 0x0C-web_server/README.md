### How The Web Works
The web is a complex system of interconnected technologies and protocols that enable the exchange of information over the internet.
At a high level, the web works as follows:
1. A user enters a web address (URL) in their web browser, such as https://www.example.com/.
2. The browser sends a request to the server hosting the website, asking for the webpage corresponding to the URL.
3. The server responds to the request with the webpage HTML, along with any other assets such as images, scripts, or stylesheets.
4. The browser receives the HTML and begins rendering the webpage.
5. As the webpage loads, the browser may need to make additional requests to the server for other assets such as images or scripts.
6. The browser uses the HTML and other assets to display the webpage to the user.

Behind the scenes, the web relies on a number of technologies and protocols that enable this communication between the browser and the server. Here are some of the key components:
- **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**: the protocol used to transfer data between the browser and server. HTTP requests are sent from the browser to the server, and HTTP responses are sent from the server to the browser.
- **HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)**: the language used to create webpages. HTML defines the structure and content of the webpage.
- **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**: a language used to define the presentation and style of a webpage, including layout, colors, and fonts.
- **JavaScript**: a programming language used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to webpages.
- **Web servers**: software programs that receive and respond to HTTP requests, serving webpages and other assets to the browser.
- **DNS (Domain Name System)**: a system that translates human-readable domain names (such as example.com) into IP addresses, which are used to identify servers on the internet.
